## For the owner

STATE: BUILDING, 08:21 IST. Three slices are merged into the trunk (core U-01 the build pipeline and shell; engine U-05 ids, dates and the game derivations; core U-03 and U-02 the UI core, router, tokens and components); trunk build/offline-v1 at 68371bb5, pushed. Running: core's last unit (U-04, the encrypted Store, with two reviewers) and, from 08:21, actions-sos U-09. Memory was 9.3 to 9.9 GB free before those two started.
NEEDS YOU: (1) decisions O1–O9 and Q10–Q13 (PLAN.md section 9) take their defaults at 08:25 unless you answer in one line, e.g. `O1-O9 default, Q10-Q13 default`; (2) memory is the bottleneck now: each running lane takes about 3 GB, not the 0.7 GB the plan assumed, so only one lane runs at a time while the pharma program holds the machine; anything you can free (the 630k-context planner chat, idle browser tabs, a pharma pause if it has one) is one more lane on this build; (3) keep the machine awake.
NEXT: the HUB merges actions-sos U-09 and core U-04 as they come READY; then engine's next units, tests-docs (the browser harness), learn, as memory allows (a third lane at 7 GB free); the CORE chat hands over to a fresh one at its next safe point (its context is near the 250k mark); FREEZE 10:55, QUIET to 11:40, TAG offline-v1.0 about 11:55.

## Merges

- 07:41 core READY-SLICE 8bf7b5c (U-01) -> 7eaf7f4, trunk fde4bbbd. build GREEN 103409 B; guards GREEN by name (15 screen tour-target names baselined until the screens land).
- 07:44 engine READY-SLICE 04fc0c1 (U-05) -> 6089dad, trunk 33d2a04f. build GREEN 127289 B; test GREEN (logic.test.mjs); validate SKIP until U-08.
- 08:19 core READY-SLICE 4a43190 (U-03, U-02) -> 063b261, trunk 68371bb5. build GREEN 187464 B; test GREEN (store.test.mjs). The generated 1-addic.html conflicted and was rebuilt from the merged sources.
- Queue: empty.

## Blockers and questions

- Memory is shared with the pharma program: rows 9.7 GB (07:25, nothing running), 3.4 (07:36, two builders), 5.8-6.3 (07:46-08:06, one builder), 9.3 (08:17, nothing running). A running lane costs about 3 GB measured. Two lanes run at a time; a third when a row shows 7 GB free with two running.
- The planner chat (session e4492b2a) is at 630k context: not a track of this program; closing it frees memory for a lane.
- Decisions: none answered yet; defaults apply at 08:25.
